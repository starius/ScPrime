# Introduction

## Welcome to the ScPrime Storage Platform API!
> Example GET curl call 

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/wallet/transactions?startheight=1&endheight=250"
```

> Example POST curl call with data

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "amount=123&destination=abcd" "localhost:4280/wallet/siacoins"
```

> Example POST curl call without data or authentication

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -X POST "localhost:4280/gateway/connect/123.456.789.0:4281"
```

API calls return either JSON or no content. Success is indicated by 2xx HTTP
status codes, while errors are indicated by 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes. If an
endpoint does not specify its expected status code refer to [standard
responses](#Standard-Responses).

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not
guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used in
production.

**Notes:**

- Requests must set their User-Agent string to contain the substring
  "ScPrime-Agent".
- By default, spd listens on "localhost:4280". This can be changed using the
  `--api-addr` flag when running spd.
- **Do not bind or expose the API to a non-loopback address unless you are aware
  of the possible dangers.**

## Documentation Standards

The following details the documentation standards for the API endpoints.

 - Endpoints should follow the structure of:
    - Parameters
    - Response
 - Each endpoint should have a corresponding curl example
   - For formatting there needs to be a newline between `> curl example` and the
     example
 - All non-standard responses should have a JSON Response example with units
   - For formatting there needs to be a newline between `> JSON Response
     Example` and the example
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all JSON response fields
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all query string parameters
 - Query String Parameters should be separated into **REQUIRED** and
   **OPTIONAL** sections
   - Detailed descriptions should be structured as "**field** | units"
   - For formatting there needs to be two spaces after the units so that the
     description is on a new line
 - All code blocks should specify `go` as the language for consistent formatting

Contributors should follow these standards when submitting updates to the API
documentation.  If you find API endpoints that do not adhere to these
documentation standards please let the ScPrime team know by submitting an issue

# Standard Responses

## Success
The standard response indicating the request was successfully processed is HTTP
status code `204 No Content`. If the request was successfully processed and the
server responded with JSON the HTTP status code is `200 OK`. Specific endpoints
may specify other 2xx status codes on success.

## Error

```go
{
    "message": String

    // There may be additional fields depending on the specific error.
}
```

The standard error response indicating the request failed for any reason, is a
4xx or 5xx HTTP status code with an error JSON object describing the error.

### Module Not Loaded

A module that is not reachable due to not being loaded by siad will return
the custom status code `490 ModuleNotLoaded`. This is only returned during
startup. Once the startup is complete and the module is still not available,
ModuleDisabled will be returned.

### Module Disabled

A module that is not reachable due to being disabled, will return the custom
status code `491 ModuleDisabled`.

# Authentication
> Example POST curl call with Authentication

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> --data "amount=123&destination=abcd" "localhost:4280/wallet/siacoins"

```

API authentication is enabled by default, using a password stored in a flat
file. The location of this file is:

 - Linux:   `$HOME/.scprime/apipassword`
 - MacOS:   `$HOME/Library/Application Support/ScPrime/apipassword`
 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ScPrime\apipassword`

Note that the file contains a trailing newline, which must be trimmed before
use.

Authentication is HTTP Basic Authentication as described in [RFC
2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617), however, the username is the empty
string. The flag does not enforce authentication on all API endpoints. Only
endpoints that expose sensitive information or modify state require
authentication.

For example, if the API password is "foobar" the request header should include

`Authorization: Basic OmZvb2Jhcg==`

And for a curl call the following would be included

`--user "":<apipassword>`

Authentication can be disabled by passing the `--authenticate-api=false` flag to
spd. You can change the password by modifying the password file, setting the
`SIA_API_PASSWORD` environment variable, or passing the `--temp-password` flag
to spd.

# Units

Unless otherwise noted, all parameters should be identified in their smallest
possible unit. For example, size should always be specified in bytes and
ScPrimecoins should always be specified in hastings. JSON values returned by the API
will also use the smallest possible unit, unless otherwise noted.

If a number is returned as a string in JSON, it should be treated as an
arbitrary-precision number (bignum), and it should be parsed with your
language's corresponding bignum library. Currency values are the most common
example where this is necessary.

# Environment Variables
There are three environment variables supported by spd.
 - `SCPRIME_API_PASSWORD` is the environment variable that sets a custom API
   password if the default is not used
 - `SCPRIME_DATA_DIR` is the environment variable that tells spd where to put the
   general ScPrime node data, e.g. api password, configuration, logs, etc.
 - `DAEMON_DATA_DIR` is the environment variable that tells spd where to put the
   spd-specific data
 - `SCPRIME_WALLET_PASSWORD` is the environment variable that can be set to enable
   auto unlocking the wallet

# Consensus

The consensus set manages everything related to consensus and keeps the
blockchain in sync with the rest of the network. The consensus set's API
endpoint returns information about the state of the blockchain.

## /consensus [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/consensus"
```

Returns information about the consensus set, such as the current block height.
Also returns the set of constants in use in the consensus code.

```

Streams a series of consensus changes, starting from the provided change ID.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**id** | string
The consensus change ID to subscribe from. There are two sentinel values:
to subscribe from the genesis block use:
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Msg contains information about an issue.

**module** | string  
Module is the module which caused the alert.

**severity** | string  
Severity is either "warning", "error" or "critical" where "error" might be a
lack of internet access and "critical" would be a lack of funds and contracts
that are about to expire due to that.

## /daemon/constants [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/daemon/constants"

}
```
**blockfrequency** | blockheight  
BlockFrequency is the desired number of seconds that should elapse, on average,
between successive Blocks.

**blocksizelimit** | uint64  
BlockSizeLimit is the maximum size of a binary-encoded Block that is permitted
by the consensus rules.

**extremefuturethreshold** | timestamp  
ExtremeFutureThreshold is a temporal limit beyond which Blocks are discarded by
the consensus rules. When incoming Blocks are processed, their Timestamp is
allowed to exceed the processor's current time by a small amount. But if the
Timestamp is further into the future than ExtremeFutureThreshold, the Block is
immediately discarded.

**futurethreshold** | timestamp  
FutureThreshold is a temporal limit beyond which Blocks are discarded by the
consensus rules. When incoming Blocks are processed, their Timestamp is allowed
to exceed the processor's current time by no more than FutureThreshold. If the
excess duration is larger than FutureThreshold, but smaller than
ExtremeFutureThreshold, the Block may be held in memory until the Block's
Timestamp exceeds the current time by less than FutureThreshold.

**genesistimestamp** | timestamp  
GenesisBlock is the first block of the block chain

**maturitydelay** | blockheight  
MaturityDelay specifies the number of blocks that a maturity-required output is
required to be on hold before it can be spent on the blockchain. Outputs are
maturity-required if they are highly likely to be altered or invalidated in the
event of a small reorg. One example is the block reward, as a small reorg may
invalidate the block reward. Another example is a siafund payout, as a tiny
reorg may change the value of the payout, and thus invalidate any transactions
spending the payout. File contract payouts also are subject to a maturity delay.

**mediantimestampwindow** | uint64  
MedianTimestampWindow tells us how many blocks to look back when calculating the
median timestamp over the previous n blocks. The timestamp of a block is not
allowed to be less than or equal to the median timestamp of the previous n
blocks, where for ScPrime this number is typically 11.

**siafundcount** | currency  
SiafundCount is the total number of Siafunds in existence.

**siafundportion** | big.Rat  
SiafundPortion is the percentage of siacoins that is taxed from FileContracts.

**targetwindow** | blockheight  
TargetWindow is the number of blocks to look backwards when determining how much
time has passed vs. how many blocks have been created. It's only used in the
old, broken difficulty adjustment algorithm.

**initialcoinbase** | uint64  
InitialCoinbase is the coinbase reward of the Genesis block.

**minimumcoinbase** | uint64  
MinimumCoinbase is the minimum coinbase reward for a block. The coinbase
decreases in each block after the Genesis block, but it will not decrease past
MinimumCoinbase.

**roottarget** | target  
RootTarget is the target for the genesis block - basically how much work needs
to be done in order to mine the first block. The difficulty adjustment algorithm
takes over from there.

**rootdepth** | target  
RootDepth is the cumulative target of all blocks. The root depth is essentially
the maximum possible target, there have been no blocks yet, so there is no
cumulated difficulty yet.

**defaultallowance** | allowance  
DefaultAllowance is the set of default allowance settings that will be used when
allowances are not set or not fully set

**maxtargetadjustmentup** | big.Rat  
MaxTargetAdjustmentUp restrict how much the block difficulty is allowed to
change in a single step, which is important to limit the effect of difficulty
raising and lowering attacks.

**maxtargetadjustmentdown** | big.Rat  
MaxTargetAdjustmentDown restrict how much the block difficulty is allowed to
change in a single step, which is important to limit the effect of difficulty
raising and lowering attacks.

**siacoinprecision** | currency 
SiacoinPrecision is the number of base units in a siacoin. This field is kept
for compatibility reasons. 10^24 of these a siacoin.

**scprimecoinprecision** | currency  
ScPrimecoinPrecision is the number of base units in a scprimecoin. The ScPrime 
network has a very large number of base units. For trading and accounting we 
define 10^27 of these a scprimecoin.

```
```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data '{"action":"set","addresses":[]}' "localhost:4280/gateway/blocklist"
```

performs actions on the Gateway's blocklist. There are three `actions` that can
be performed. `append` and `remove` are used for appending or removing addresses
from the Gateway's blocklist. `set` is used to define all the addresses in the
blocklist. If a list of addresses is provided with `set`, that list of addresses
will become the Gateway's blocklist, replacing any blocklist that was currently
in place. To clear the Gateway's blocklist, submit an empty list with `set`.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**action** | string  
this is the action to be performed on the blocklist. Allowed inputs are
`append`, `remove`, and `set`.

```
**externalsettings**    
The settings that get displayed to untrusted nodes querying the host's status.  
  
**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
Whether or not the host is accepting new contracts.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download
request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger
batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the
renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.


**maxduration** | blocks  
The maximum duration that a host will allow for a file contract. The host
commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a
large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The
storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current
height + maxduration.  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single batch of file contract revisions. The renter can
perform DoS attacks on the host by uploading a batch of data then refusing to
provide a signature to pay for the data. The host can reduce this exposure by
limiting the batch size. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there
is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.


**netaddress** | string  
The IP address or hostname (including port) that the host should be contacted
at.  

**remainingstorage** | bytes  
The amount of unused storage capacity on the host in bytes. It should be noted
that the host can lie.  

**sectorsize** | bytes  
The smallest amount of data in bytes that can be uploaded or downloaded when
performing calls to the host.  

**totalstorage** | bytes  
The total amount of storage capacity on the host. It should be noted that the
host can lie.  

**unlockhash** | hash  
The unlock hash is the address at which the host can be paid when forming file
contracts.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
The storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a
storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window
that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage
that is contracted by the renter.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file
contract.  

**contractprice** | hastings  
The price that a renter has to pay to create a contract with the host. The
payment is intended to cover transaction fees for the file contract revision and
the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.  

**downloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.  

**storageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.  

**uploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.  

**revisionnumber** | int  
The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host
is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple
conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with
the higher revision number to be more recent.  

**version** | string  
The version of external settings being used. This field helps coordinate updates
while preserving compatibility with older nodes.  

**financialmetrics**    
The financial status of the host.  
  
**contractcount** | int  
Number of open file contracts.  

**contractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file
contracts. The host is required to submit a file contract revision and a storage
proof for every file contract that gets created, and the renter pays for the
miner fees on  these objects.  

**potentialcontractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file
contracts which have not been confirmed yet. The potential compensation becomes
compensation after the storage proof is submitted.  

**lockedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of storage collateral which the host has tied up in file contracts.
The host has to commit collateral to a file contract even if there is no
storage, but the locked collateral will be returned even if the host does not
submit a storage proof - the collateral is not at risk, it is merely set aside
so that it can be put at risk later.  

**lostrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue, including storage revenue and bandwidth revenue, that has
been lost due to failed file contracts and failed storage proofs.  

**loststoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of collateral that was put up to protect data which has been lost due
to failed file contracts and missed storage proofs.  

**potentialstoragerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue that the host stands to earn if all storage proofs are
submitted correctly and in time.

**riskedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has risked on file contracts. If the host
starts missing storage proofs, the host can forfeit up to this many coins. In
the event of a missed storage proof, locked storage collateral gets returned,
but risked storage collateral does not get returned.  

**storagerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has earned from storing data. This money has
been locked down by successful storage proofs.  

**transactionfeeexpenses** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has spent on transaction fees when submitting
host announcements, file contract revisions, and storage proofs.  

**downloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters downloading their files.
This money has been locked in by successful storage proofs.

**potentialdownloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that downloaded
their files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully
submits storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**potentialuploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that uploaded
files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully submits
storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**uploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters uploading their files.
This money has been locked in by successful storage proofs.  

**internalsettings**    
The settings of the host. Most interactions between the user and the host occur
by changing the internal settings.  

**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
When set to true, the host will accept new file contracts if the terms are
reasonable. When set to false, the host will not accept new file contracts at
all.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download
request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger
batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the
renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.


**maxduration** | blocks  
The maximum duration of a file contract that the host will accept. The storage
proof window must end before the current height + maxduration.  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single batch of file contract revisions. The renter can
perform DoS attacks on the host by uploading a batch of data then refusing to
provide a signature to pay for the data. The host can reduce this exposure by
limiting the batch size. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there
is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.


**netaddress** | string  
The IP address or hostname (including port) that the host should be contacted
at. If left blank, the host will automatically figure out its ip address and use
that. If given, the host will use the address given.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
The storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a
storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window
that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral per byte per
block of storage that is contracted by the renter.  

**collateralbudget** | hastings  
The total amount of money that the host will allocate to collateral across all
file contracts.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file
contract.

**minbaserpcprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter for interacting with
the host. This is charged for every interaction a renter has with a host to pay
for resources consumed during the interaction. It is added to the
`mindownloadbandwidthprice` and `minuploadbandwidthprice` when uploading or
downloading files from the host.

**mincontractprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when forming a
contract. Typically this price is to cover transaction fees on the file contract
revision and storage proof, but can also be used if the host has a low amount of
collateral. The price is a minimum because the host may automatically adjust the
price upwards in times of high demand.  

**mindownloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when the renter is
downloading data. If the host is saturated, the host may increase the price from
the minimum.

**minsectoraccessprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter for accessing a sector
of data on disk. Since the host has to read at least a full 4MB sector from disk
regardless of how much the renter intends to download this is charged to pay for
the physical disk resources the host uses. It is multiplied by the number of
sectors read then added to the `mindownloadbandwidthprice` when downloading a
file.

**minstorageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The minimum price that the host will demand when storing data for extended
periods of time. If the host is low on space, the price of storage may be set
higher than the minimum.  

**minuploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when the renter is
uploading data. If the host is saturated, the host may increase the price from
the minimum.  

**ephemeralaccountexpiry** | seconds  
The  maximum amount of time an ephemeral account can be inactive before it is
considered to be expired and gets deleted. After an account has expired, the
account owner has no way of retrieving the funds. Setting this value to 0 means
ephemeral accounts never expire, regardless of how long they have been inactive.

**maxephemeralaccountbalance** | hastings  
The maximum amount of money that the host will allow a user to deposit into a
single ephemeral account.

**maxephemeralaccountrisk** | hastings  
To increase performance, the host will allow a user to withdraw from an
ephemeral account without requiring the user to wait until the host has
persisted the updated ephemeral account balance to complete a transaction. This
means that the user can perform actions such as downloads with significantly
less latency. This also means that if the host loses power at that exact moment,
the host will forget that the user has spent money and the user will be able to
spend that money again.

maxephemeralaccountrisk is the maximum amount of money that the host is willing
to risk to a system failure. The account manager will keep track of the total
amount of money that has been withdrawn, but has not yet been persisted to disk.
If a user's withdrawal would put the host over the maxephemeralaccountrisk, the
host will wait to complete the user's transaction until it has persisted the
widthdrawal, to prevent the host from having too much money at risk.

Note that money is only at risk if the host experiences an unclean shutdown
while in the middle of a transaction with a user, and generally the amount at
risk will be minuscule unless the host experiences an unclean shutdown while in
the middle of many transactions with many users at once. This value should be
larger than maxephemeralaccountbalance but does not need to be significantly
larger.

**networkmetrics**    
Information about the network, specifically various ways in which renters have
contacted the host.  

**downloadcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has attempted to download something from the
host.  

**errorcalls** | int  
The number of calls that have resulted in errors. A small number of errors are
expected, but a large number of errors indicate either buggy software or
malicious network activity. Usually buggy software.  

**formcontractcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has tried to form a contract with the host.  

**renewcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has tried to renew a contract with the host.  

**revisecalls** | int  
The number of times that the renter has tried to revise a contract with the
host.  

**settingscalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has queried the host for the host's settings.
The settings include the price of bandwidth, which is a price that can adjust
every few minutes. This value is usually very high compared to the others.  

**unrecognizedcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has attempted to use an unrecognized call.
Larger numbers typically indicate buggy software.  

**connectabilitystatus** | string  
connectabilitystatus is one of "checking", "connectable", or "not connectable",
and indicates if the host can connect to itself on its configured NetAddress.  

**workingstatus** | string  
workingstatus is one of "checking", "working", or "not working" and indicates if
the host is being actively used by renters.

**publickey** | SiaPublicKey  
Public key used to identify the host.

for resources consumed during the interaction. It is added to the
`mindownloadbandwidthprice` and `minuploadbandwidthprice` when uploading or
downloading files from the host.

**mincontractprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when forming a
contract. Typically this price is to cover transaction fees on the file contract

spend that money again.

maxephemeralaccountrisk is the maximum amount of money that the host is willing
to risk to a system failure. The account manager will keep track of the total
amount of money that has been withdrawn, but has not yet been persisted to disk.
If a user's withdrawal would put the host over the maxephemeralaccountrisk, the
host will wait to complete the user's transaction until it has persisted the
widthdrawal, to prevent the host from having too much money at risk.

Note that money is only at risk if the host experiences an
unclean shutdown while in the middle of a transaction with a user, and generally
the amount at risk will be minuscule unless the host experiences an unclean
shutdown while in the middle of many transactions with many users at once. This
value should be larger than 'maxephemeralaccountbalance but does not need to be
significantly larger.

    }
  ]
}
```
**path** | string  
Absolute path to the storage folder on the local filesystem.  

**capacity** | bytes  
Maximum capacity of the storage folder in bytes. The host will not store more
than this many bytes in the folder. This capacity is not checked against the
drive's remaining capacity. Therefore, you must manually ensure the disk has
sufficient capacity for the folder at all times. Otherwise you risk losing
renter's data and failing storage proofs.  

**capacityremaining** | bytes  
Unused capacity of the storage folder in bytes.  

**failedreads, failedwrites** | int

## /host/storage/folders/add [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&size=1000000000000" "localhost:4280/host/storage/folders/add"
```

adds a storage folder to the manager. The manager may not check that there is
enough space available on-disk to support as much storage as requested

### Storage Folder Limits
A host can only have 65536 storage folders in total which have to be between 256
MiB and 16 PiB in size

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to add.  

**size** | bytes  
Initial capacity of the storage folder. This value isn't validated so it is
possible to set the capacity of the storage folder greater than the capacity of
the disk. Do not do this.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/remove [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&force=false" "localhost:4280/host/storage/folders/remove"
```

Remove a storage folder from the manager. All storage on the folder will be
moved to other stoarge folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the
manager is unable to save data, an error will be returned and the operation will
be stopped.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to removed.  

### OPTIONAL
**force** | boolean  
If `force` is true, the storage folder will be removed even if the data in the
storage folder cannot be moved to other storage folders, typically because they
don't have sufficient capacity. If `force` is true and the data cannot be moved,
data will be lost.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/resize [POST]
> curl example  

```sh
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&newsize=1000000000000" "localhost:4280/host/storage/folders/resize"
```

Grows or shrinks a storage file in the manager. The manager may not check that
there is enough space on-disk to support growing the storasge folder, but should
gracefully handle running out of space unexpectedly. When shrinking a storage
folder, any data in the folder that needs to be moved will be placed into other
storage folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the manager is unable to
migrate the data, an error will be returned and the operation will be stopped.

### Storage Folder Limits
See [/host/storage/folders/add](#host-storage-folders-add-post)

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to resize.  

**newsize** | bytes  
Desired new size of the storage folder. This will be the new capacity of the
storage folder.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/sectors/delete/:*merkleroot* [POST]
> curl example  

```sh
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:4280/host/storage/sectors/delete/[merkleroot]"
```

Deletes a sector, meaning that the manager will be unable to upload that sector
and be unable to provide a storage proof on that sector. This endpoint is for
removing the data entirely, and will remove instances of the sector appearing at
all heights. The primary purpose is to comply with legal requests to remove
data.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**merkleroot** | merkleroot  
Merkleroot of the sector to delete.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/estimatescore [GET]
> curl example

{
  "estimatedscore": "123456786786786786786786786742133",  // big int
  "conversionrate": 95  // float64
}
```
**estimatedscore** | big int  
estimatedscore is the estimated HostDB score of the host given the settings
passed to estimatescore.  
  
**conversionrate** | float64  
conversionrate is the likelihood given the settings passed to estimatescore that
the host will be selected by renters forming contracts.  

# Host DB

The hostdb maintains a database of all hosts known to the network. The database
identifies hosts by their public key and keeps track of metrics such as price.

## /hostdb [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/hostdb"
```

Shows some general information about the state of the hostdb.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
    "initialscancomplete": false  // boolean
}
```
**initialscancomplete** | boolean  
indicates if all known hosts have been scanned at least once.

## /hostdb/active [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/hostdb/active"
```

lists all of the active hosts known to the renter, sorted by preference.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL
**numhosts** | int  
Number of hosts to return. The actual number of hosts returned may be less if
there are insufficient active hosts. Optional, the default is all active hosts.

```

**hosts**  
**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
true if the host is accepting new contracts.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum number of bytes that the host will allow to be requested by a single
download request.  

**maxduration** | blocks  
Maximum duration in blocks that a host will allow for a file contract. The host
commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a
large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The
storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current
height + maxduration.  

There is a block approximately every 10 minutes. e.g. 1 day = 144 blocks  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum size in bytes of a single batch of file contract revisions. Larger batch
sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead
associated with performing a batch upload.  

**netaddress** | string  
Remote address of the host. It can be an IPv4, IPv6, or hostname, along with the
port. IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets.  

**remainingstorage** | bytes  
Unused storage capacity the host claims it has.  

**sectorsize** | bytes  
Smallest amount of data in bytes that can be uploaded or downloaded to or from
the host.  

**totalstorage** | bytes  
Total amount of storage capacity the host claims it has.  

**unlockhash** | hash  
Address at which the host can be paid when forming file contracts.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
A storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a
storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window
that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage
that is contracted by the renter.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file
contract.  

**contractprice** | hastings  
The price that a renter has to pay to create a contract with the host. The
payment is intended to cover transaction fees for the file contract revision and
the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.  

**downloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.  

**storageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.  

**uploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.  

**revisionnumber** | int  
The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host
is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple
conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with
the higher revision number to be more recent.  

**version** | string  
The version of the host.  

**firstseen** | blocks  
Firstseen is the last block height at which this host was announced.  

**historicdowntime** | nanoseconds  
Total amount of time the host has been offline.  

**historicuptime** | nanoseconds  
Total amount of time the host has been online.  

**scanhistory** Measurements that have been taken on the host. The most recent
measurements are kept in full detail.  

**historicfailedinteractions** | int  
Number of historic failed interactions with the host.  

**historicsuccessfulinteractions** | int Number of historic successful
interactions with the host.  

**recentfailedinteractions** | int  
Number of recent failed interactions with the host.  

**recentsuccessfulinteractions** | int  
Number of recent successful interactions with the host.  

**lasthistoricupdate** | blocks  
The last time that the interactions within scanhistory have been compressed into
the historic ones.  

**ipnets**  
List of IP subnet masks used by the host. For IPv4 the /24 and for IPv6 the /54
subnet mask is used. A host can have either one IPv4 or one IPv6 subnet or one
of each. E.g. these lists are valid: [ "IPv4" ], [ "IPv6" ] or [ "IPv4", "IPv6"
]. The following lists are invalid: [ "IPv4", "IPv4" ], [ "IPv4", "IPv6", "IPv6"
]. Hosts with an invalid list are ignored.  

**lastipnetchange** | date  
The last time the list of IP subnet masks was updated. When equal subnet masks
are found for different hosts, the host that occupies the subnet mask for a
longer time is preferred.  

**publickey** | SiaPublicKey  
Public key used to identify and verify hosts.  

**algorithm** | string  
Algorithm used for signing and verification. Typically "ed25519".  

**key** | hash  
Key used to verify signed host messages.  

**publickeystring** | string  
The string representation of the full public key, used when calling
/hostdb/hosts.  

**filtered** | boolean  
Indicates if the host is currently being filtered from the HostDB

## /hostdb/all [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/hostdb/all"
```

Lists all of the hosts known to the renter. Hosts are not guaranteed to be in
any particular order, and the order may change in subsequent calls.

### JSON Response 
Response is the same as [`/hostdb/active`](#hosts)

## /hostdb/hosts/:*pubkey* [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/hostdb/hosts/ed25519:8a95848bc71e9689e2f753c82c35dc47a1d62867f77c0113ebb6fa5b51723215"
```

fetches detailed information about a particular host, including metrics
regarding the score of the host within the database. It should be noted that
each renter uses different metrics for selecting hosts, and that a good score on
in one hostdb does not mean that the host will be successful on the network
overall.

### Path Parameters
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/hostdb/hosts/<pubkey>"
```
### REQUIRED
**pubkey**  
The public key of the host. Each public key identifies a single host.  

Example Pubkey:
ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

  }
}
```
Response is the same as [`/hostdb/active`](#hosts) with the additional of the
**scorebreakdown**

**scorebreakdown**  
A set of scores as determined by the renter. Generally, the host's final score
is all of the values multiplied together. Modified renters may have additional
criteria that they use to judge a host, or may ignore certin criteia. In
general, these fields should only be used as a loose guide for the score of a
host, as every renter sees the world differently and uses different metrics to
evaluate hosts.  

**score** | big int  
The overall score for the host. Scores are entriely relative, and are consistent
only within the current hostdb. Between different machines, different
configurations, and different versions the absolute scores for a given host can
be off by many orders of magnitude. When displaying to a human, some form of
normalization with respect to the other hosts (for example, divide all scores by
the median score of the hosts) is recommended.  

**ageadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how long it has been a
host. Older hosts typically have a lower penalty.  

**basepriceadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on if the `BaseRPCPRice` and
the `SectorAccessPrice` are reasonable.  

**burnadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how much proof-of-burn the
host has performed. More burn causes a linear increase in score.  

**collateraladjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much collateral the host
is offering. More collateral is typically better, though above a point it can be
detrimental.  

**conversionrate** | float64  
conversionrate is the likelihood that the host will be selected by renters
forming contracts.  

**durationadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the max duration it accepts
for file contracts. Typically '1' for hosts with an acceptable max duration, and
'0' for hosts that have a max duration which is not long enough.

**interactionadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on previous interactions with
the host. A high ratio of successful interactions will improve this hosts score,
and a high ratio of failed interactions will hurt this hosts score. This
adjustment helps account for hosts that are on unstable connections, don't keep
their wallets unlocked, ran out of funds, etc.  

**pricesmultiplier** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the host's price. Lower
prices are almost always better. Below a certain, very low price, there is no
advantage.  

**storageremainingadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much storage is
remaining for the host. More storage remaining is better, to a point.  

**uptimeadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the uptime percentage of the
host. The penalty increases extremely quickly as uptime drops below 90%.  

**versionadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the version of ScPrime that they
are running. Versions get penalties if there are known bugs, scaling
limitations, performance limitations, etc. Generally, the most recent version is
always the one with the highest score.  

## /hostdb/filtermode [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/hostdb/filtermode"
```  
Returns the current filter mode of the hostDB and any filtered hosts.

### JSON Response 
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "filtermode": "blacklist",  // string
  "hosts":
    [
      "ed25519:122218260fb74b20a8be3000ad56a931f7461ea990a6dc5676c31bdf65fc668f"  // string
    ]
}

```
**filtermode** | string  
Can be either whitelist, blacklist, or disable.  

**hosts** | array of strings  
Comma separated pubkeys.  

## /hostdb/filtermode [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> --data '{"filtermode" : "whitelist","hosts" : ["ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef","ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef","ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"]}' "localhost:4280/hostdb/filtermode"
```  
```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> --data '{"filtermode" : "disable"}' "localhost:4280/hostdb/filtermode"
```
Lets you enable and disable a filter mode for the hostdb. Currently the two
modes supported are `blacklist` mode and `whitelist` mode. In `blacklist` mode,
any hosts you identify as being on the `blacklist` will not be used to form
contracts. In `whitelist` mode, only the hosts identified as being on the
`whitelist` will be used to form contracts. In both modes, hosts that you are
blacklisted will be filtered from your hostdb. To enable either mode, set
`filtermode` to the desired mode and submit a list of host pubkeys as the
corresponding `blacklist` or `whitelist`. To disable either list, the `host`
field can be left blank (e.g. empty slice) and the `filtermode` should be set to
`disable`.  

**NOTE:** Enabling and disabling a filter mode can result in changes with your
current contracts with can result in an increase in contract fee spending. For
example, if `blacklist` mode is enabled, any hosts that you currently have
contracts with that are also on the provide list of `hosts` will have their
contracts replaced with non-blacklisted hosts. When `whitelist` mode is enabled,
contracts will be replaced until there are only contracts with whitelisted
hosts. Even disabling a filter mode can result in a change in contracts if there
are better scoring hosts in your hostdb that were previously being filtered out.


### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**filtermode** | string  
Can be either whitelist, blacklist, or disable.  

**hosts** | array of string  
Comma separated pubkeys.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

# Miner

The miner provides endpoints for getting headers for work and submitting solved
headers to the network. The miner also provides endpoints for controlling a
basic CPU mining implementation.

## /miner [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/miner"
```
returns the status of the miner.

### JSON Response 
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "blocksmined":      9001,   // int
  "cpuhashrate":      1337,   // hashes / second
  "cpumining":        false,  // boolean
  "staleblocksmined": 0,      // int
}
```
**blocksmined** | int  
Number of mined blocks. This value is remembered after restarting.  

**cpuhashrate** | hashes / second  
How fast the cpu is hashing, in hashes per second.  

**cpumining** | boolean  
true if the cpu miner is active.  

**staleblocksmined** | int  
Number of mined blocks that are stale, indicating that they are not included in
the current longest chain, likely because some other block at the same height
had its chain extended first.  


## /miner/start [GET]
> curl example  

```sh
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/miner/start"
```

Starts a single threaded CPU miner. Does nothing if the CPU miner is already
running.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /miner/stop [GET]
> curl example  

```sh
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/miner/stop"
```

stops the cpu miner. Does nothing if the cpu miner is not running.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /miner/block [POST]
> curl example  

```sh
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -data "<byte-encoded-block>" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/miner/block"
```

Submits a solved block and broadcasts it.

### Byte Request

For efficiency the block is submitted in a raw byte encoding using the ScPrime
encoding.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).


## /miner/header [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/miner/header"
```

provides a block header that is ready to be grinded on for work.

### Byte Response
For efficiency the header for work is returned as a raw byte encoding of the
header, rather than encoded to JSON.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the
header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with
that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64
possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call
/miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle
root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash
of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan
block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the
ScPrime Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is
the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs
(one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction).
Modifying this field will result in an invalid block.

Field | Byte range within response | Byte range within header
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
target | [0-32)
header | [32-112)
parent block ID | [32-64) | [0-32)
nonce | [64-72) | [32-40)
timestamp | [72-80) | [40-48)
merkle root | [80-112) | [48-80)

## /miner/header [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -data "<byte-encoded-header>" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/miner"
```

submits a header that has passed the POW.

### Byte Request
For efficiency headers are submitted as raw byte encodings of the header in the
body of the request, rather than as a query string parameter or path parameter.
The request body should contain only the 80 bytes of the encoded header. The
encoding is the same encoding used in `/miner/header [GET]` endpoint.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the
header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with
that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64
possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call
/miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle
root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash
of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan
block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the
ScPrime Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is
the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs
(one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction).
Modifying this field will result in an invalid block.

Field | Byte range within request | Byte range within header
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
target | [0-32)
header | [32-112)
parent block ID | [32-64) | [0-32)
nonce | [64-72) | [32-40)
timestamp | [72-80) | [40-48)
merkle root | [80-112) | [48-80)

# Renter

The renter manages the user's files on the network. The renter's API endpoints
expose methods for managing files on the network and managing the renter's
allocated funds.

## /renter [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/renter"
```

Returns the current settings along with metrics on the renter's spending.

**settings**    
Settings that control the behavior of the renter.  

**allowance**   
Allowance dictates how much the renter is allowed to spend in a given period.
Note that funds are spent on both storage and bandwidth.  

**funds** | hastings  
Funds determines the number of siacoins that the renter will spend when forming
contracts with hosts. The renter will not allocate more than this amount of
siacoins into the set of contracts each billing period. If the renter spends all
of the funds but then needs to form new contracts, the renter will wait until
either until the user increase the allowance funds, or until a new billing
period is reached. If there are not enough funds to repair all files, then files
may be at risk of getting lost.

**hosts** | int  
Hosts sets the number of hosts that will be used to form the allowance. ScPrime
gains most of its resiliancy from having a large number of hosts. More hosts
will mean both more robustness and higher speeds when using the network, however
will also result in more memory consumption and higher blockchain fees. It is
recommended that the default number of hosts be treated as a minimum, and that
double the default number of default hosts be treated as a maximum.

**period** | blocks  
The period is equivalent to the billing cycle length. The renter will not spend
more than the full balance of its funds every billing period. When the billing
period is over, the contracts will be renewed and the spending will be reset.

**renewwindow** | blocks  
The renew window is how long the user has to renew their contracts. At the end
of the period, all of the contracts expire. The contracts need to be renewed
before they expire, otherwise the user will lose all of their files. The renew
window is the window of time at the end of the period during which the renter
will renew the users contracts. For example, if the renew window is 1 week long,
then during the final week of each period the user will renew their contracts.
If the user is offline for that whole week, the user's data will be lost.

Each billing period begins at the beginning of the renew window for the previous
period. For example, if the period is 12 weeks long and the renew window is 4
weeks long, then the first billing period technically begins at -4 weeks, or 4
weeks before the allowance is created. And the second billing period begins at
week 8, or 8 weeks after the allowance is created. The third billing period will
begin at week 20.

**expectedstorage** | bytes  
Expected storage is the amount of storage that the user expects to keep on the
ScPrime network. This value is important to calibrate the spending habits of spd.
Because ScPrime is decentralized, there is no easy way for spd to know what the
real world cost of storage is, nor what the real world price of a siacoin is. To
overcome this deficiency, spd depends on the user for guidance.

If the user has a low allowance and a high amount of expected storage, spd will
more heavily prioritize cheaper hosts, and will also be more comfortable with
hosts that post lower amounts of collateral. If the user has a high allowance
and a low amount of expected storage, spd will prioritize hosts that post more
collateral, as well as giving preference to hosts better overall traits such as
uptime and age.

Even when the user has a large allowance and a low amount of expected storage,
spd will try to optimize for saving money; spd tries to meet the users storage
and bandwidth needs while spending significantly less than the overall
allowance.

**expectedupload** | bytes  
Expected upload tells spd how much uploading the user expects to do each month.
If this value is high, spd will more strongly prefer hosts that have a low
upload bandwidth price. If this value is low, spd will focus on other metrics
than upload bandwidth pricing, because even if the host charges a lot for upload
bandwidth, it will not impact the total cost to the user very much.

The user should not consider upload bandwidth used during repairs, spd will
consider repair bandwidth separately.

**expecteddownload** | bytes  
Expected download tells spd how much downloading the user expects to do each
month. If this value is high, spd will more strongly prefer hosts that have a
low download bandwidth price. If this value is low, spd will focus on other
metrics than download bandwidth pricing, because even if the host charges a lot
for downloads, it will not impact the total cost to the user very much.

The user should not consider download bandwidth used during repairs, spd will
consider repair bandwidth separately.

**expectedredundancy** | bytes  
Expected redundancy is used in conjunction with expected storage to determine
the total amount of raw storage that will be stored on hosts. If the expected
storage is 1 TB and the expected redundancy is 3, then the renter will calculate
that the total amount of storage in the user's contracts will be 3 TiB.

This value does not need to be changed from the default unless the user is
manually choosing redundancy settings for their file. If different files are
being given different redundancy settings, then the average of all the
redundancies should be used as the value for expected redundancy, weighted by
how large the files are.

**maxuploadspeed** | bytes per second  
MaxUploadSpeed by default is unlimited but can be set by the user to manage
bandwidth.  

**maxdownloadspeed** | bytes per second  
MaxDownloadSpeed by default is unlimited but can be set by the user to manage
bandwidth.  

**streamcachesize** | int  
The StreamCacheSize is the number of data chunks that will be cached during
streaming.  

**financialmetrics**    
Metrics about how much the Renter has spent on storage, uploads, and downloads.


**contractfees** | hastings  
Amount of money spent on contract fees, transaction fees and siafund fees.  

**contractspending** | hastings, (deprecated, now totalallocated)  
How much money, in hastings, the Renter has spent on file contracts, including
fees.  

**downloadspending** | hastings  
Amount of money spent on downloads.  

**storagespending** | hastings  
Amount of money spend on storage.  

**totalallocated** | hastings  
Total amount of money that the renter has put into contracts. Includes spent
money and also money that will be returned to the renter.  

**uploadspending** | hastings  
Amount of money spent on uploads.  

**unspent** | hastings  
Amount of money in the allowance that has not been spent.  

**currentperiod** | blockheight  
Height at which the current allowance period began.  

**nextperiod** | blockheight  
Height at which the next allowance period began.  

**uploadsstatus**  
Information about the renter's uploads.  

**paused** | boolean  
Indicates whether or not the uploads and repairs are paused.  

**pauseendtime** | unix timestamp  
The time at which the pause will end.  

## /renter [POST]
> curl example  

```go

**checkforipviolation** | boolean  
Enables or disables the check for hosts using the same ip subnets within the
hostdb. It's turned on by default and causes ScPrime to not form contracts with
hosts from the same subnet and if such contracts already exist, it will
deactivate the contract which has occupied that subnet for the shorter time.

## /renter/contracts [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/renter/contracts?disabled=true&expired=true&recoverable=false"
```

Returns the renter's contracts. Active, passive, and refreshed contracts are
returned by default. Active contracts are contracts that the Renter is currently
using to store, upload, and download data. Passive contracts are contracts that
are no longer GoodForUpload but are GoodForRenew. This means the data will
continue to be available to be downloaded from. Refreshed contracts are
contracts that ran out of funds and needed to be renewed so more money could be
added to the contract with the host. The data reported in these contracts is
duplicate data and should not be included in any accounting. Disabled contracts
are contracts that are in the current period and have not yet expired that are
not being used for uploading as they were replaced instead of renewed. Expired
contracts are contracts with an `EndHeight` in the past, where no more data is
being stored and excess funds have been released to the renter. Expired
Refreshed contracts are contracts that were refreshed at some point in a
previous period. The data reported in these contracts is duplicate data and
should not be included in any accounting. Recoverable contracts are contracts
which the contractor is currently trying to recover and which haven't expired
yet.

| Type              | GoodForUpload | GoodForRenew | Endheight in the Future | Data Counted Elsewhere Already|
| ----------------- | :-----------: | :----------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------------: |

| Refreshed         | No            | No           | Yes                     | Yes                           |
| Disabled          | No            | No           | Yes                     | No                            |
| Expired           | No            | No           | No                      | No                            |
| Expired Refreshed | No            | No           | No                      | Yes                           |

**NOTE:** No spending is double counted anywhere in the contracts, only the data
is double counted in the refreshed contracts. For spending totals in the current
period, all spending in active, passive, refreshed, and disabled contracts
should be counted. For data totals, the data in active and passive contracts is
the total uploaded while the data in disabled contracts is wasted uploaded data.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL
**disabled** | boolean  
flag indicating if disabled contracts should be returned.

**expired** | boolean  
flag indicating if expired contracts should be returned.

**recoverable** | boolean

relative to 'home/user/'.  

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**action** | string  
Action can be either `create`, `delete` or `rename`.
 - `create` will create an empty directory on the ScPrime network
 - `delete` will remove a directory and its contents from the ScPrime network. Will
   return an error if the target is a file.

    }
  ]
}
```
**files**  

**accesstime** | timestamp  
indicates the last time the siafile was accessed

**available** | boolean  
true if the file is available for download. A file is available to download once
it has reached at least 1x redundancy. Files may be available before they have
reached 100% upload progress as upload progress includes the full expected
redundancy of the file.  

**changetime** | timestamp  
indicates the last time the siafile metadata was updated

**ciphertype** | string  
indicates the encryption used for the siafile

**createtime** | timestamp  
indicates when the siafile was created

**expiration** | block height  
Block height at which the file ceases availability.  

**filesize** | bytes  
Size of the file in bytes.  

**health** | float64 health is an indication of the amount of redundancy missing
where 0 is full redundancy and >1 means the file is not available. The health of
the siafile is the health of the worst unstuck chunk.

**localpath** | string  
Path to the local file on disk.  
**NOTE** `spd` will set the localpath to an empty string if the local file is
not found on disk. This is done to avoid the siafile being corrupted in the
future by a different file being placed on disk at the original localpath
location.  

**maxhealth** | float64  
the maxhealth is either the health or the stuckhealth of the siafile, whichever
is worst

**maxhealthpercent** | float64  
maxhealthpercent is the maxhealth converted to be out of 100% to be more easily
understood

**modtime** | timestamp  
indicates the last time the siafile contents where modified

**numstuckchunks** | uint64  
indicates the number of stuck chunks in a file. A chunk is stuck if it cannot
reach full redundancy

**ondisk** | boolean  
indicates if the source file is found on disk

**recoverable** | boolean  
indicates if the siafile is recoverable. A file is recoverable if it has at
least 1x redundancy or if `spd` knows the location of a local copy of the file.

**redundancy** | float64  
When a file is uploaded, it is first broken into a series of chunks. Each chunk
goes on a different set of hosts, and therefore different chunks of the file can
have different redundancies. The redundancy of a file as reported from the API
will be equal to the lowest redundancy of any of  the file's chunks.

**renewing** | boolean  
true if the file's contracts will be automatically renewed by the renter.  

**siapath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.  

**stuck** | bool  
a file is stuck if there are any stuck chunks in the file, which means the file
cannot reach full redundancy

**stuckhealth** | float64  
stuckhealth is the worst health of any of the stuck chunks.

**uploadedbytes** | bytes  
Total number of bytes successfully uploaded via current file contracts. This
number includes padding and rendundancy, so a file with a size of 8192 bytes
might be padded to 40 MiB and, with a redundancy of 5, encoded to 200 MiB for
upload.  

**uploadprogress** | percent  
Percentage of the file uploaded, including redundancy. Uploading has completed
when uploadprogress is 100. Files may be available for download before upload
progress is 100.  

## /renter/file/*siapath* [GET]

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### OPTIONAL
**root** | bool  
Whether or not to treat the siapath as being relative to the user's home
directory. If this field is not set, the siapath will be interpreted as relative
to 'home/user/'.

downloads a file to the local filesystem. The call will block until the file has
been downloaded.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED (Either one or the other)
**destination** | string  
Location on disk that the file will be downloaded to.  

**httpresp** | boolean  
If httresp is true, the data will be written to the http response.

Length of the requested data. Has to be <= filesize-offset.  

**offset** | bytes  
Offset relative to the file start from where the download starts.  

### Response

Unlike most responses, this response modifies the http response header. The
download will set the 'ID' field in the http response header to a unique
identifier which can be used to cancel an async download with the
/renter/download/cancel endpoint and retrieve a download's info from the
download history using the /renter/downloadinfo endpoint. Apart from that the
response is a standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/download/cancel [POST]

## /renter/fuse [GET]
> curl example  

```bash
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/renter/fuse"
```

Lists the set of folders that have been mounted to the user's filesystem and
which mountpoints have been used for each mount.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "mountpoints": [ // []modules.MountInfo
    {
      "mountpoint": "/home/user/siavideos", // string
      "siapath": "/videos",                 // modules.SiaPath

      "mountoptions": { // []modules.MountOptions
          "allowother": false, // bool
          "readonly": true,    // bool
        },
    },
  ]
}
```
**mountpoint** | string  
The system path that is being used to mount the fuse folder.

**siapath** | string  
The siapath that has been mounted to the mountpoint.

## /renter/fuse/mount [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:4280/renter/fuse/mount?readonly=true"
```

Mounts a ScPrime directory to the local filesystem using FUSE.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**mount** | string  
Location on disk to use as the mountpoint.

**readonly** | bool  
Whether the directory should be mounted as ReadOnly. Currently, readonly is a
required parameter and must be set to true.

### OPTIONAL
**siapath** | string  
Which path should be mounted to the filesystem. If left blank, the user's home
directory will be used.

**allowother** | boolean  
By default, only the system user that mounted the fuse directory will be allowed
to interact with the directory. Often, applications like Plex run as their own
user, and therefore by default are banned from viewing or otherwise interacting
with the mounted folder. Setting 'allowother' to true will allow other users to
see and interact with the mounted folder.

On Linux, if 'allowother' is set to true, /etc/fuse.conf needs to be modified so
that 'user_allow_other' is set. Typically this involves uncommenting a single
line of code, see the example below of an /etc/fuse.conf file that has
'use_allow_other' enabled.

```bash
# /etc/fuse.conf - Configuration file for Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)

# Set the maximum number of FUSE mounts allowed to non-root users.
# The default is 1000.
#mount_max = 1000

# Allow non-root users to specify the allow_other or allow_root mount options.
user_allow_other

```

change the siaPath for a file that is being managed by the renter.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**newsiapath** | string  
New location of the file in the renter on the network.  

### OPTIONAL
**root** | bool  
Whether or not to treat the siapath as being relative to the user's home
directory. If this field is not set, the siapath will be interpreted as
relative to 'home/user/'.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/stream/*siapath* [GET]
> curl example  

> Stream the whole file.  

```sh
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/renter/stream/myfile"
```  

> The file can be streamed partially by using standard partial http requests
> which means setting the "Range" field in the http header.  

```sh
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -H "Range: bytes=0-1023" "localhost:4280/renter/stream/myfile"
```

downloads a file using http streaming. This call blocks until the data is
received. The streaming endpoint also uses caching internally to prevent spd
from re-downloading the same chunk multiple times when only parts of a file are
requested at once. This might lead to a substantial increase in ram usage and
therefore it is not recommended to stream multiple files in parallel at the
moment. This restriction will be removed together with the caching once partial
downloads are supported in the future. If you want to stream multiple files you
should increase the size of the Renter's `streamcachesize` to at least 2x the
number of files you are steaming.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### OPTIONAL
**disablelocalfetch** | boolean  
If disablelocalfetch is true, downloads won't be served from disk even if the
file is available locally.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/upload/*siapath* [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "source=/home/myfile" "localhost:4280/renter/upload/myfile"
```

uploads a file to the network from the local filesystem.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string  
Location where the file will reside in the renter on the network. The path must
be non-empty, may not include any path traversal strings ("./", "../"), and may
not begin with a forward-slash character.  

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**source** | string  
Location on disk of the file being uploaded.  

### OPTIONAL
**datapieces** | int  
The number of data pieces to use when erasure coding the file.  

**paritypieces** | int  
The number of parity pieces to use when erasure coding the file. Total
redundancy of the file is (datapieces+paritypieces)/datapieces.  

**force** | boolean  
Delete potential existing file at siapath.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/uploadstream/*siapath* [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/renter/uploadstream/myfile?datapieces=10&paritypieces=20" --data-binary @myfile.dat

curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/renter/uploadstream/myfile?repair=true" --data-binary @myfile.dat
```

uploads a file to the network using a stream. If the upload stream POST call
fails or quits before the file is fully uploaded, the file can be repaired by a
subsequent call to the upload stream endpoint using the `repair` flag.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**siapath** | string  
Location where the file will reside in the renter on the network. The path must
be non-empty, may not include any path traversal strings ("./", "../"), and may
not begin with a forward-slash character.  

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL
**datapieces** | int  
The number of data pieces to use when erasure coding the file.  

**paritypieces** | int  
The number of parity pieces to use when erasure coding the file. Total
redundancy of the file is (datapieces+paritypieces)/datapieces.  

**force** | boolean  
Delete potential existing file at siapath.

**repair** | boolean  
Repair existing file from stream. Can't be specified together with datapieces,
paritypieces and force.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/uploadready [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/renter/uploadready?datapieces=10&paritypieces=20"
```

Returns the whether or not the renter is ready for upload.

### Path Parameters
### OPTIONAL
datapieces and paritypieces are both optional, however if one is supplied then
the other needs to be supplied. If neither are supplied then the default values
for the erasure coding will be used 

**datapieces** | int  
The number of data pieces to use when erasure coding the file.  

**paritypieces** | int  
The number of parity pieces to use when erasure coding the file.   

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

{
"ready":false,            // bool
"contractsneeded":30,     // int
"numactivecontracts":20,  // int
"datapieces":10,          // int
"paritypieces":20         // int 
}
```
**ready** | boolean  
ready indicates if the renter is ready to fully upload a file based on the
erasure coding.  

**contractsneeded** | int  
contractsneeded is how many contracts are needed to fully upload a file.  

**numactivecontracts** | int  
numactivecontracts is the number of active contracts the renter has.

**datapieces** | int  
The number of data pieces to use when erasure coding the file.  

**paritypieces** | int

## /renter/uploads/pause [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "duration=10m" "localhost:4280/renter/uploads/pause"
```

This endpoint will pause any future uploads or repairs for the duration
requested. Any in progress chunks will finish. This can be used to free up
the workers to exclusively focus on downloads. Since this will pause file
repairs it is advised to not pause for too long. If no duration is supplied
then the default duration of 600 seconds will be used. If the uploads are
already paused, additional calls to pause the uploads will result in the
duration of the pause to be reset to the duration supplied as opposed to
pausing for an additional length of time.

### Path Parameters
#### OPTIONAL 
**duration** | string  
duration is how long the repairs and uploads will be paused in seconds. If no
duration is supplied the default pause duration will be used.

### Response
standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/uploads/resume [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/renter/uploads/resume"
```

This endpoint will resume uploads and repairs.

### Response

responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/validatesiapath/*siapath* [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/renter/validatesiapath/isthis-aval_idsiapath"
```

validates whether or not the provided siapath is a valid siapath. Every path
valid under Unix is valid as a SiaPath.

### Path Parameters

# Wallet

## /wallet [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/wallet"
```

Returns basic information about the wallet, such as whether the wallet is locked
or unlocked.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "encrypted":  true,   // boolean
  "unlocked":   true,   // boolean
  "rescanning": false,  // boolean

  "confirmedsiacoinbalance":     "123456", // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins": "0",      // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedincomingsiacoins": "789",    // hastings, big int

  "siafundbalance":      "1",    // siafunds, big int
  "siacoinclaimbalance": "9001", // hastings, big int

  "dustthreshold": "1234", // hastings / byte, big int
}
```
**encrypted** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet has been encrypted or not. If the wallet has not
been encrypted, then no data has been generated at all, and the first time the
wallet is unlocked, the password given will be used as the password for
encrypting all of the data. 'encrypted' will only be set to false if the wallet
has never been unlocked before (the unlocked wallet is still encrypted - but the
encryption key is in memory).  

**unlocked** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently locked or unlocked. Some calls become
unavailable when the wallet is locked.  

**rescanning** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently rescanning the blockchain. This will
be true for the duration of calls to /unlock, /seeds, /init/seed, and
/sweep/seed.  

**confirmedsiacoinbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, available to the wallet as of the most recent
block in the blockchain.  

**unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, that are leaving the wallet according to the
set of unconfirmed transactions. Often this number appears inflated, because
outputs are frequently larger than the number of coins being sent, and there is
a refund. These coins are counted as outgoing, and the refund is counted as
incoming. The difference in balance can be calculated using
'unconfirmedincomingsiacoins' - 'unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins'  

**unconfirmedincomingsiacoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, are entering the wallet according to the set of
unconfirmed transactions. This number is often inflated by outgoing siacoins,
because outputs are frequently larger than the amount being sent. The refund
will be included in the unconfirmed incoming siacoins balance.  

**siafundbalance** | big int  
Number of siafunds available to the wallet as of the most recent block in the
blockchain.  

**siacoinclaimbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, that can be claimed from the siafunds as of the
most recent block. Because the claim balance increases every time a file
contract is created, it is possible that the balance will increase before any
claim transaction is confirmed.  

**dustthreshold** | hastings / byte, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings per byte, below which a transaction output
cannot be used because the wallet considers it a dust output.  

## /wallet/033x [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "source=/home/legacy-wallet&encryptionpassword=mypassword" "localhost:4280/wallet/033x"
```

Loads a v0.3.3.x wallet into the current wallet, harvesting all of the secret
keys. All spendable addresses in the loaded wallet will become spendable from
the current wallet.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**source**  
Path on disk to the v0.3.3.x wallet to be loaded.  

**encryptionpassword**  
Encryption key of the wallet.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/address [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/wallet/address"
```

Gets a new address from the wallet generated by the primary seed. An error will
be returned if the wallet is locked.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "address": "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab"
}
```

Wallet address that can receive siacoins or siafunds. Addresses are 76 character
long hex strings.  

## /wallet/addresses [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/wallet/addresses"
```

Fetches the list of addresses from the wallet. If the wallet has not been
created or unlocked, no addresses will be returned. After the wallet is
unlocked, this call will continue to return its addresses even after the wallet
is locked again.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "addresses": [ // []hash
    "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab",

    "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  ]
}
```
**addresses** | hashes  
Array of wallet addresses owned by the wallet.  

## /wallet/seedaddrs [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/wallet/seedaddrs"
```

Fetches addresses generated by the wallet in reverse order. The last address
generated by the wallet will be the first returned. This also means that
addresses which weren't generated using the wallet's seed can't be retrieved
with this endpoint.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL
**count**  
Number of addresses that should be returned. If count is not specified or if
count is bigger than the number of addresses generated by the wallet, all
addresses will be returned.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "addresses": [ // []hash
    "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab",

  ]
}
```
**addresses** | hashes  
Array of wallet addresses previously generated by the wallet.

## /wallet/backup [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/wallet/backup?destination=/home/wallet-settings.backup"
```

Creates a backup of the wallet settings file. Though this can easily be done
manually, the settings file is often in an unknown or difficult to find
location. The /wallet/backup call can spare users the trouble of needing to find
their wallet file.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**destination**  
Path to the location on disk where the backup file will be saved.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/changepassword [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:4280/wallet/changepassword?encryptionpassword=<currentpassword>&newpassword=<newpassword>"
```

Changes the wallet's encryption key.  

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**encryptionpassword** | string  
encryptionpassword is the wallet's current encryption password or primary seed.


**newpassword** | string  
newpassword is the new password for the wallet.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/init [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "encryptionpassword=<password>&force=false" "localhost:4280/wallet/init"
```

Initializes the wallet. After the wallet has been initialized once, it does not
need to be initialized again, and future calls to /wallet/init will return an
error. The encryption password is provided by the api call. If the password is
blank, then the password will be set to the same as the seed.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL WALLET PARAMETERS
**encryptionpassword** | string  
Password that will be used to encrypt the wallet. All subsequent calls should
use this password. If left blank, the seed that gets returned will also be the
encryption password.  

**dictionary** | string  
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is
the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

**force** | boolean  
When set to true /wallet/init will Reset the wallet if one exists instead of
returning an error. This allows API callers to reinitialize a new wallet.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "primaryseed": "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello"
}
```
**primaryseed**  
Wallet seed used to generate addresses that the wallet is able to spend.  

## /wallet/init/seed [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "seed=<seed>&encryptionpassword=<password>&force=false" "localhost:4280/wallet/init/seed"
```

Initializes the wallet using a preexisting seed. After the wallet has been
initialized once, it does not need to be initialized again, and future calls to
/wallet/init/seed will return an error. The encryption password is provided by
the api call. If the password is blank, then the password will be set to the
same as the seed. Note that loading a preexisting seed requires scanning the
blockchain to determine how many keys have been generated from the seed. For
this reason, /wallet/init/seed can only be called if the blockchain is synced.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED WALLET PARAMETERS
**seed** | string  
Dictionary-encoded phrase that corresponds to the seed being used to initialize
the wallet.  

### OPTIONAL
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/seed [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "seed=<seed>" "localhost:4280/wallet/seed"
```

Gives the wallet a seed to track when looking for incoming transactions. The
wallet will be able to spend outputs related to addresses created by the seed.
The seed is added as an auxiliary seed, and does not replace the primary seed.
Only the primary seed will be used for generating new addresses.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
[Required Wallet Parameters](#required-wallet-parameters)

### OPTIONAL | string
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/seeds [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:4280/wallet/seeds"
```

Returns the list of seeds in use by the wallet. The primary seed is the only
seed that gets used to generate new addresses. This call is unavailable when the
wallet is locked.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**dictionary** | string  
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is
the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "primaryseed":        "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello",
  "addressesremaining": 2500,
  "allseeds":           [

  ]
}
```
**primaryseed**  
Seed that is actively being used to generate new addresses for the wallet.  

**addressesremaining**  
Number of addresses that remain in the primary seed until exhaustion has been
reached. Once exhaustion has been reached, new addresses will continue to be
generated but they will be more difficult to recover in the event of a lost
wallet file or encryption password.  

**allseeds**  
Array of all seeds that the wallet references when scanning the blockchain for
outputs. The wallet is able to spend any output generated by any of the seeds,
however only the primary seed is being used to generate new addresses.  

## /wallet/siacoins [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "amount=1000&destination=c134a8372bd250688b36867e6522a37bdc391a344ede72c2a79206ca1c34c84399d9ebf17773" "localhost:4280/wallet/siacoins"
```

Sends siacoins to an address or set of addresses. The outputs are arbitrarily
selected from addresses in the wallet. If 'outputs' is supplied, 'amount',
'destination' and 'feeIncluded' must be empty.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED

**amount** | hastings  
Number of hastings being sent. A hasting is the smallest unit in ScPrime. There are
10^24 hastings in a siacoin.

**destination** | address  
Address that is receiving the coins.  

**OR**

**outputs**  
JSON array of outputs. The structure of each output is: {"unlockhash":
"<destination>", "value": "<amount>"}

### OPTIONAL

should be at least one keyfile per required signature. The filenames need to be
comma separated (no spaces), which means filepaths that contain a comma are not
allowed.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/sign [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "<requestbody>" "localhost:4280/wallet/sign"
```

Signs a transaction. The wallet will attempt to sign each input specified. The
transaction's TransactionSignatures should be complete except for the Signature
field. If `tosign` is provided, the wallet will attempt to fill in signatures
for each TransactionSignature specified. If `tosign` is not provided, the wallet
will add signatures for every TransactionSignature that it has keys for.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**transaction**  
Raw transaction. The rest of the fields in the response are determined from this
raw transaction. It is left undocumented here as the processed transaction (the
rest of the fields in this object) are usually what is desired.

See types.Transaction in
https://gitlab.com/scpcorp/ScPrime/blob/master/types/transactions.go  

**transactionid**  
ID of the transaction from which the wallet transaction was derived.  

**confirmationheight**  
Block height at which the transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is
unconfirmed the height will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**confirmationtimestamp**  
Time, in unix time, at which a transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is
unconfirmed the timestamp will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**inputs**  
Array of processed inputs detailing the inputs to the transaction.  

**parentid**  
The id of the output being spent.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund represented by the input. Possible values are 'siacoin input' and
'siafund input'.  

**walletaddress** | boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For inputs (outgoing money), the related address is
usually not important because the wallet arbitrarily selects which addresses
will fund a transaction.  

**value** | hastings or siafunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the input.  

**outputs**  
Array of processed outputs detailing the outputs of the transaction. Outputs
related to file contracts are excluded.  

**id**  
The id of the output that was created.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund is represented by the output. Possible values are 'siacoin output',
'siafund output', 'claim output', and 'miner payout'. Siacoin outputs and claim
outputs both relate to siacoins.  

Siafund outputs relate to siafunds.  

Miner payouts point to siacoins that have been spent on a miner payout. Because
the destination of the miner payout is determined by the block and not the
transaction, the data 'maturityheight', 'walletaddress', and 'relatedaddress'
areleft blank.  

**maturityheight**  
Block height the output becomes available to be spent. Siacoin outputs and
siafund outputs mature immediately - their maturity height will always be the
confirmation height of the transaction. Claim outputs cannot be spent until they
have had 144 confirmations, thus the maturity height of a claim output will
always be 144 larger than the confirmation height of the transaction.  

**walletaddress** | boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For outputs (incoming money), the related address
field can be used to determine who has sent money to the wallet.  

**value** | hastings or siafunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the output.  

## /wallet/transactions [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "ScPrime-Agent" "localhost:4280/wallet/transactions"
```

Returns a list of transactions related to the wallet in chronological order.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**startheight** | block height  
Height of the block where transaction history should begin.

**endheight** | block height  
Height of of the block where the transaction history should end. If 'endheight'
is greater than the current height, or if it is '-1', all transactions up to and
including the most recent block will be provided.

### JSON Response
