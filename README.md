ScPrime is a decentralized cloud storage platform based on the ScPrime core 
protocol. Leveraging smart contracts, client-side encryption, and sophisticated
redundancy (via Reed-Solomon codes), ScPrime allows users to safely store their 
data with hosts that they do not know or trust. The result is a cloud storage 
marketplace where hosts compete to offer the best service at the lowest price. 
Hosts can include everyone from individual hobbyists up to enterprise-scale 
datacenters with excess capacity to sell. 

The ScPrime protocol currently provides very basic storage capability. We expect
the ScPrime product suite will begin to roll out in 2020 as we work in parallel
with ScPrime core developers to deliver live products as soon as the protocol can 
support them. As time passes, we expect the ScPrime protocol to diverge from 
the ScPrime protocol in some ways as we build an industrial strength version.

Traditional cloud storage is dominated by a small number of companies.
ScPrime is an initiative to provide small and medium sized business (SMB) a 
comprehensive cloud storage environment uncompromised by inside 
or outside interference. This is achieved through fragmenting user data and 
spreading it across a distributed network of hosts. No single datacenter has 
access to your complete data.

These fragments are duplicated over enough hosts that even if several hosts 
disappear, your data is still accessible. Switching to different hosts for 
better geographic coverage, price, speed or reliability is easy as hosts 
compete with each other to provide the best service offering. 

ScPrime will offer a complete cloud storage solution for file backup, long term 
archival needs, CDN use cases as well as bridging the gap between online and 
offline strategies. The ScPrime network allows for highly parallel data transfer, 
which when coupled with geographic targeting can significantly reduce latency
and access to your data no matter if you are storing family photos or large 
database backups.

The process of choosing hosts on the ScPrime network allows customers to 
choose based on latency, lowest price, widest geographic coverage, or even a 
strict whitelist of IP addresses or public keys. We expect to provide customers 
multiple ways to purchase storage on the ScPrime network, including simple 
Dropbox-like web interfaces up to sophisticated client dashboards for 
enterprise clients.

Purchasing storage on the network will have several variants, though all 
ultimately use our core cryptocurrency utility coin called a ScPrime Coin. 
ScPrime Coins will be available on cryptocurrency exchanges. We will also be 
creating fiat to storage gateways to encourage broad adoption of the ScPrime 
storage model. 

Usage
-----
This release comes with 2 binaries, `spd` and `spc`. `spd` is a background
service, or "daemon," that runs the ScPrime protocol and exposes an HTTP API on
port 4280. `spc` is a command-line client that can be used to interact with
`spd` in a user-friendly way. There is also a web browser access based version
available from [Downloads](https://scpri.me/software/),
which is a way of using ScPrime for wallet users.

For interested developers, the `spd` API is documented [here](doc/API.md).

To start the daemon directly on Windows, double-click `spd.exe`. For command 
line operation and custom options, navigate to the containing folder and click 
File->Open command prompt. To start the `spd` service with default settings 
enter `spd` and press Enter. To see the available options type `spd -h` and 
press Enter.
The command prompt may appear to freeze; 
this means `spd` is waiting for requests. Windows users may see a warning from 
Windows Firewall; be sure to check both boxes ("Private networks" and "Public 
networks") and click "Allow access." You can now run `spc` (in a separate command
prompt) or ScPrime-UI to interact with `spd`. 

Building From Source
--------------------

To build from source, [Go 1.19 or above must be installed](https://golang.org/doc/install)
on the system. Clone the repo and run `make`:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/scpcorp/ScPrime
cd ScPrime && make
```

This will install the`spd` and `spc` binaries in your `$GOPATH/bin` folder.
(By default, this is `$HOME/go/bin`.)

You can also run `make test` and `make test-long` to run the short and full test
suites, respectively. Finally, `make cover` will generate code coverage reports
for each package; they are stored in the `cover` folder and can be viewed in
your browser.

### Running on a Raspberry Pi

Official binaries are not provided for the Raspberry Pi, but you can easily
compile them yourself by installing the Go toolchain on your Raspberry Pi.
Alternatively, you can cross-compile by running `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 make`.
Raspberry Pi compatible binaries will then be installed in
`$GOPATH/bin/linux_arm64/`.
