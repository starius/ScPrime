Latest:
### v1.5.4
- Remove NebulousLabs feemanager module


### v1.5.0
**Key Updates**
- Add `zip` download format and set it as default format.

Publinks. It disables the default path functionality, guaranteeing that the user
will not be automatically redirected to `/index.html` if it exists in the 
pubfile.
